# intro Html & Css
### Text:
there are multible tags to write a diffirent types of the text like:
* Headings:h1/h2/h3...
* paregrapgh: "<p>"
* bold text : "<b>"
* italic/em/opliqe : like this *H* but in different degrees 
* line break: "<br>"
* bold text but different from b : "<strong>"
 ### Css part:
 css code contains selector , property & a value
 to add a css code we can do it with three ways:
 1. external file which is the best
 2. internal file inside the head tag
 3. inline within the html tag
 to target a spacific tag we can use the selectors but every element has its own selector such as:
 1. the html tag : just the name tag
 2. the classes: dot then the class name 
 3. the Ids: hashtag then the id name
 4. universal selector : "*" which select all the elements inside the css file

 ### the javascript part :
 the js script contains a bunsh of statements which will be executed one by one and every statement should end with ";"

 also we have variables and there are many types of them such as:
 1. Number
 2. string
 3. bolean
 4. Arrays
 5. objects...etc
  if we want to declare a var we should give a name and we can add a value using the assign operator "="

there are rules to name the var such as:
1. begin with a letter
2. begin with _ or $
3. don't use a preserve javascript word..etc

#### comparison operator:
1. == : equal the value
2. === : equal the value and the type
3. !== : not equal the value and the type
4. != : not equal the value

logical operators
&&: if one at least wrong it will return wrong
||: if one at least true it will return true
!: it means not equal

we can use this operators in the if statement with the condition
the if statement execute the first code if the value of the condiyion is true
if wrong go to if else wrong go to the last else and execute if the if else was wrong for sure
