# Css part :

### The position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

* statics: not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page
* relative: is positioned relative to its normal position
* fixed: is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled
* absolute: is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
* sticky: is positioned based on the user's scroll position.


### fLoating eLements :

The float property is used for positioning and formatting content
The float property can have one of the following values:

* left - The element floats to the left of its container
* right - The element floats to the right of its container
* none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
* inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
