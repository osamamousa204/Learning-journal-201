### How People Access the Web??

* web browsers
* web servers : which contains the web page info
* Devices : such as (desktop computers,smart phones,tablets,laptops..)
* Screen readers
### How Websites Are Created?
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

## HTML
#### What does the html file do?
HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages

- HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages
- essential elements that used by any html page:
* the html tag
* head
* body
* title
### conclusion
* HTML pages are text documents
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

#### comment in html:
If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
<!-- comment goes here -->
#### ID Attribute:
Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
#### Class Attribute:
Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
#### Block Elements:
Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.
#### Inline Elements :
Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.
#### Grouping Text & Elements In a Block :
(Div) :The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
#### Grouping Text & Elements Inline
(span):The <span> element acts like
an inline equivalent of the <div>
element. It is used to either :
1. Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable
element to differentiate it from
its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline
elements

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

### HTML5 LAYOUT
* The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

## Process & Design
### Who is the Site For?
Target Audience: individuals
* What is the age range of your target audience?
* Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
* Which country do your visitors live in?
* Do they live in urban or rural areas?
* What is the average income of visitors?
* What level of education do they have?
Target Audience: Companies
What is the size of the company or relevant department?
* What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
* Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
* How large is the budget they control?

### Why People Visit YOUR Website?
##### Specific Goals:
* Do they want general information / research (suchas background on a topic /company), or are they after something specific (such as a
particular fact or information
on a product)?
* Are they already familiar with
the service or product that
you offer or do they need to
be introduced to it?

#### Design
Getting your message across using design
##### Prioritizing :
If everything on a page appeared
in the same style, it would be
much harder to understand. (Key
messages would not stand out.)
By making parts of the page
look distinct from surrounding
content, designers draw
attention to (or away from)
those items.
#### Organizing :
Grouping together related
content into blocks or chunks
makes the page look simpler
(and easier to understand).
Users should be able to
identify the purpose of each
block without processing each
individual item.
