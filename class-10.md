## Code Debugging

Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.

Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.


Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging

### The console.log() Method

If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window.

#### debugger

The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.

Syntax:
debugger;

##### JavaScript Errors - Throw and Try to Catch
The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.

The catch statement lets you handle the error.

The throw statement lets you create custom errors.

The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.
