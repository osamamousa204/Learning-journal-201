# Html part :

HTML Images Syntax
In HTML, images are defined with the `<img>` tag.

The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

### The alt Attribute:

The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

### Image as a Link:

To use an image as a link, put the `<img>` tag inside the `<a>` tag

* the HTML <img> element to define an image
* the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
* the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
* the HTML width and height attributes to define the size of the image
* the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image (alternatively)
* the CSS float property to let the image float

* To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
