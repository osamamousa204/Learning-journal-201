# javascript part:

**Constructors** are special member functions whose task is to initialize the objects of its class. It is treated as a special member function because its name is the same as the class name. Java constructors are invoked when their objects are created. It is named such because, it constructs the value, i.e., provide data for the object, i.e., they are used to initialize objects. Every class has a constructor when we don't explicitly declare a constructor for any java class the compiler creates a default constructor for that class which does not have any return type. The constructor in Java cannot be abstract, static, final or synchronized and these modifiers are not allowed for the constructor
